*Note: The website is currently in its staging phase and is hosted on a temporary URL while final development is completed.*

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP

My process as a consultant begins with an understanding of where my clients are coming from, what their business needs and goals are, their budget, and what they envision for their online presence and brand.

The discussion involves careful planning to set and align expectations and pinpoint what the project is all about.

Once decided, a proposal followed by a contract outlining the project are signed.

Creation begins with a deposit and I stay in contact with my clients to communicate and provide timely updates.

Finally, the website is deployed once full payment is received.
